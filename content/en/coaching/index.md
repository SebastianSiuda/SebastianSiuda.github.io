<h1 style="text-align: center;">Coaching</h1>

In both professional and personal contexts, we often face situations where an outside perspective can be helpful. You might want to strengthen your leadership skills, reflect on key decisions, better understand team dynamics, or realign personal goals. This is where my coaching comes in: solution-oriented, respectful, and tailored to your individual questions.

## When is coaching helpful?

Coaching provides the opportunity to reflect on professional and personal challenges in a structured way and actively address them.  
Common coaching topics include:

- Career transitions or planning
- Preparing for leadership roles and people management
- Stress management & burnout prevention
- Conflict resolution at work or in personal life
- Building self-confidence (e.g., for presentations)
- Improving work-life balance and time management

Together, we develop customized solutions - clear, practical, and grounded.

## My approach

With a doctorate in social psychology (Dr. rer. pol.) and licensure in psychotherapy under the German Heilpraktikergesetz (HeilprG), I bring a strong academic foundation combined with practical coaching expertise. My approach is grounded in systemic coaching, focusing on the individual while always considering the broader social and interpersonal contexts that shape behavior and decision-making.

Together, we identify your resources, explore relevant patterns, and develop concrete strategies to advance your personal or professional growth.

My coaching is designed for professionals, leaders, and private individuals alike. Topics may include career decisions, leadership and team development, communication, conflict resolution, or personal potential. I also support organizations in strengthening their employees through targeted one-on-one coaching and guiding them through change processes.

In a structured and confidential setting, I help you reflect on thought and behavior patterns, expand your perspective, and develop concrete next steps - combining psychological expertise, practical experience, and a clear, solution-focused approach.
