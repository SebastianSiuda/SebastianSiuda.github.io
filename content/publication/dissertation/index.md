abstract: The first part of this dissertation focuses on potential foreign language effects on trust. Research shows that the use of a foreign language may alter people’s choices. Thus, interpersonal trust could also be susceptible to such effects. However, although the use of foreign language influenced choices in moral dilemmas, we did not find foreign language effects on trust or trustworthiness decisions. These findings are in line with the idea that interpersonal trust is principled. The second part of this dissertation focuses on trust accuracy. Judgments about people’s trustworthiness are made frequently and have important real-life consequences. However, the accuracy of these judgments is debated. I therefore systematically reviewed the current evidence for accurate trustworthiness detection. The overall evidence for accuracy was mixed; while the evidence for accurate trustworthiness detection from neutral photographs was limited, trustworthiness detection appeared to be more accurate when the rater and target interacted, when the target presentation resembled face-to-face contact, and when the target presentations contained cues or signals about the target’s trustworthiness. The third part of this dissertation empirically investigated trustworthiness detection accuracy. Results indicated that trustors’ specific trustworthiness detection was inaccurate when the participants had only limited time to get acquainted (Study 1) but was accurate when the participants were acquainted (Studies 2–4). Moreover, this accuracy was mediated by the simple heuristic “do I have a good relationship with this person?” (Studies 3–4). Importantly, while trustors accurately detected whether a trustee would be trustworthy toward them, they failed to detect whether a trustee would be trustworthy in general (Studies 3–4). Thus, rather than asking whether people know who is generally trustworthy, the more relevant question to ask is whether people know whom they can personally trust.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: My dissertation focused on three topics related to trust. Do people trust differently in their first vs. second language? Do people know whom to trust? Does the acquaintanceship between people predict how accurate they are at detecting trustworthiness?
