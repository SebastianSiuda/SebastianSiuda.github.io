      title: Teaching
      text: In addition to research, I offer courses in social, personality, and decision psychology. My goal is to make psychological theories **understandable, applicable, and – ideally – enjoyable**. All courses are designed and taught by me and can be **tailored to universities or organizations**. If you'd like to add a psychology course to your program, feel free to reach out. *(Course descriptions are provided in German but can of course also be taught in English.)*
