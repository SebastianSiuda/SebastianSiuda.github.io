      title: Teaching
      text: In addition to research, I offer courses that bring key concepts from social, personality, and decision psychology to life. I focus on making psychological theories understandable, applicable, and – ideally – enjoyable. Whether for university programs or professional trainings, I aim to connect scientific insights with real-world questions. All courses are designed and taught by me and can be tailored to the needs of academic institutions or organizations. If you're looking to add a psychology course to your curriculum or training program, feel free to get in touch. *Course descriptions are provided in German, but all courses can also be taught in English upon request.*
