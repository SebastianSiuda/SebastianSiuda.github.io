How can we better understand human behavior - and leverage this knowledge to strengthen teams, develop leadership skills, or shape social dynamics constructively?  
The course *Personality and Social Psychology* delivers well-founded psychological knowledge, applicable both in academic settings and corporate environments.

## Personality and Social Psychology for Academia & Business

The first part of the course focuses on **Personality Psychology**, addressing questions such as: Which personality traits shape individual behavior? How can personal strengths and potential be identified—and used for professional success? Using established models like the Big Five, the course provides a solid theoretical foundation complemented by practical reflection exercises.

The second part emphasizes **Social Psychology**: How do group dynamics work? What role do social norms, communication, and unconscious processes play in team decisions? Especially for companies or academic institutions focusing on collaboration, diversity management, or leadership development, this course offers valuable insights and tools for shaping social interactions.

The methodology combines research-based content with interactive elements. Real-world case studies, group exercises, and transfer tasks ensure that participants not only learn theoretical concepts but apply them directly to their academic or professional environments - whether in project teams, leadership situations, or university settings.

The course is suitable both as part of university curricula (e.g., for business, social sciences, or communication studies) and as corporate training for organizations investing in the personal development and social skills of their employees.
