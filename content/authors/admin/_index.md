    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

Hi, I am a psychologist doing research on the dynamics of interpersonal trust. I try to investigate under which conditions people trust, how they assess other people’s trustworthiness and (so far unsuccessfully) how I can become very rich from all this research.

Apart from my research at the University of Cologne, I offer talks and lecture services in the field of social and experimental psychology. If you are interested in getting in contact with me, feel free to use the contact form below.
